    "#### Reason for using inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code reuse: Inheritance allows you to define common attributes and methods in a base class and reuse them in multiple derived classes. This promotes code reuse and helps in writing cleaner and more maintainable code. Instead of duplicating code across multiple classes, you can define it once in a base class and inherit it in the derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modularity and extensibility: Inheritance facilitates the creation of modular and extensible code. By inheriting from a base class, you can add or modify the behavior of the derived class without modifying the existing code in the base class. This promotes a more modular design, where changes to one class do not affect other classes as long as they inherit from the appropriate base class."

    "#### Single Inheritance:\n",
    "- Single inheritance refers to the ability of a class to inherit from a single base class. In this approach, a derived class extends the functionality of only one base class. The derived class inherits all the attributes and behaviors of the base class and can add its own unique attributes and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplicity: Single inheritance provides a straightforward and simple class hierarchy. Each class has a clear parent-child relationship, making it easier to understand and maintain the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one base class. In this approach, a derived class can inherit attributes and behaviors from multiple base classes, combining their functionalities. This allows for more complex class relationships and the ability to reuse code from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code reuse: Multiple inheritance enables the reuse of code from multiple base classes. This can be beneficial when different classes provide distinct functionalities that need to be combined in a derived class."
